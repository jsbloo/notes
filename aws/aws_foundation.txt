Evolution of Cloud Hosting:
  Dedicated Server:
    One physical machine dedicated to a single business. 
    Runs a single web-app/site.
               |
               v
  Virtual Private Server (VPS):
    One physical machine dedicated to a single business.
    The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines.
    Runs multiple web-apps/sites.
               |
               v
  Shared Hosting:
    One physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses.
    Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.
    Very cheap, limited functionality, poor isolation
               |
               v
  Cloud Hosting:
    Multiple physical machines that act as on system.
    The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services.
    Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability. 
     
Jargon:     
  CSP: Cloud Service Provider
  SaaS: Software as a Service
  PaaS: Platform as a Service
  IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service

The 4 core services of IaaS:
  1  Compute
  2  Networking
  3  Storage
  4  Database

In AWS terms:
  Compute: EC2 (virtual machines)
  Networking: VPC (private cloud network)
  Storage: EBS (virtual hard-drives)
  Database: RDS (sql databases)

Other Services:
  A lot of other services.....

Cloud Computing Deployment Models
  Public Cloud: Everything built on CSP
  Private Cloud: Everything built on-premise
  Hybrid: Built on both premise and CSP
  Cross-Cloud: Built on multiple CSPs

Compute Power:
  General Computing: CPU Processor - EC2
  GPU Computing: For specialized compute tasks - AWS Inf1
  Quantum Compute: Experimental - AWS Bracket
